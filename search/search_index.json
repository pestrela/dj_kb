The only converters available were for MacOS. This has now changed recently.\\ All softwares take different approaches to solve the 26ms shift problem.</p> <p>This is the current situation as far as I tested it myself:</p> <ul> <li>DJ Data Converter: This is a command line tool for Windows, WSL, and macOS. This is where the full research of the 26ms shift problem was done, and where it was first implemented. This is another python converter.</li> <li>Rekord Cloud: This is a web application, so it supports all OSes. It also has many other useful features other than DJ conversion. The authors have read the research, implemented it for the 26ms case, and then extended it for virtualDJ with a 50ms value. As it is a web app, it created added an offline optional app just to scan shift mp3s.</li> <li>DJCU: This is a macOS-only application. Recently it got the hability to convert windows files, but still from macOS only. They have a manual tool to correct the shifts after conversion (REKU). More recently they correct shifts automatically using the encoder strings. This is something that I researched before and replaced with LAME/LAVC/LAVF tags instead.</li> <li>Rekordbuddy: This is also a macOS-only application. A Windows version is on the works for many years. This app corrects some shift cases correctly automaticlaly, but it misses others as well (when I tested it on a macOS VM).</li> <li>MIXXX: A new upcoming feature is reading Rekordbox-prepared USB sticks nativelly. This is of course affected by the 26ms problem. Like rekordcloud, the developers have read the research and implemented it for their case (which depends on the several mp3 libraries they use).</li> <li>Mixo: To be tested. Mixo is an upcoming web application that does cloud-based conversion among many other features. At time of writing this is not publicly available.

It is hard work.  This time comes on top of track-searching and cueing tasks.</p> <p>For some audiences like live-streaming, specialized non-commercial music styles, vinyl-only nights, etc they definitely appreciate the DJ to look and to actually be very busy.\\ To other audiences, this is not relevant at all.</p> <p>Taking the above rule into account, I then believe the following:</p> <ul> <li>Beatmatching tracks that beatgrid well is just a waste of time</li> <li>Using sync on tracks that do not beatgrid well is very damaging<ul> <li>this is why elastic beatgrids are so important</li> </ul> </li> <li>Some tricks typically associated with vinyl/beatmatching are definitely enjoyed by the audience, eg TT break / TT stop</li> <li>Beatmatching forces you to hear and known the tracks much better.

The level ranges from Intermediate to Advanced, with an emphasis in advanced, which I really enjoyed.</p> <p>An absolute bargain for the price, you get 6x completely interactive sessions where Ean explains extremly useful and real-world proven DJ techniques, covering the entire DJing spectrum. There you see Ean's real collection, tracks, cues and loops, where he shows over and over the techniques that he wrote in DJTT blog posts since 2007. https://djtechtools.com/2015/05/17/the-history-of-dj-techtools/</p> <p>Even better, you can ask any question at any time. But crucially, the questions are moderated by RandomFPV (Chris Benoit),  to ask them in the best order and at the best possible time. This SIGNIFICANTLY improves this process to be a lot more efficient and clear.</p> <p>The cherry on top of the cake is an after-party zoom call where you discuss and interact these and other  topics with your peers - the other students - from all over the world.</p> <p>AFAIK this course and format is unique. It specifically targets intermediate and advanced levels. While very high-quality as well,  AFAIK other courses are only prerecorded and are typically start at beginners and up.

The main factor of this is simplification and lower quality / minimum viable product, many times at the user burden. Some examples follow.</p> <p>Required Updates:</p> <p>To reduce cost, both backwards and forward compatibility  are dropped. Its far far simpler to the developer to just force the user to upgrade all components if just one them gets upgraded.  Instead of checking what actually changed, and if the old/unchanged functions would just work fine with the previous version.\\ Typically the server gets updated first, then the client App needs to follow.</p> <p>Some years ago changes and all protocols had compatibility in mind, so that the user could continue  using the previous version as long as possible (except urgent security updates).</p> <p>Poor Documentation:</p> <p>Today apps are far far simpler to use for the simple tasks. That is great.</p> <p>However, the complex tasks are being dumbed down by force, and worse, they are no longer documented structurally anymore.</p> <p>The existing documentation all moved online and is searchable. That is reasonable, but typically there is no longer structured manuals that would explain the features of eg your new mobile phone,  and every single configuration option.</p> <p>Other examples are the dumbing down of laptops to approach tablets by force (Windows 8 comes to mind). A Tablet is great for content consuming, but a laptop is irreplaceable for content producing.\\ Specific examples are Function and insert keys being secondary, the loss of physical buttons like ESC in mac, short keyboards without insert/delete section like it was present on the standard 102 keyboard</p> <p>Subscriptions / Ownership:</p> <p>Every year there is fewer laptop users. The \"buy once, use forever\" model is no longer profitable to small and medium businesses that make unique software.  The only solution was to ask money for newer major versions of the software. Every year this gets more and more difficult.</p> <p>The alternative is subscriptions that stop working if you stop paying. Another worrying trend is companies lawyers that removed the notion of ownership, giving you an  authorization instead. </p> <p>Yet another worrying trend is hardware features that are unlocked by software.  Back in the days, the price segmentation was clearly made because of hardware limitations: it was physically impossible to send more data / driver faster / etc. Today, the hardware has gained massive leaps in specifications, but then they come lobotomized by default, and sold as a software upgrade.</p>"},{"location":"free_dj_tools/#software-quality","title":"Software Quality","text":"<p>on the topic of software quality, please see this blog post:</p> <p>https://pestrela.github.io/dj_kb/free_dj_tools/#21st-century-software-issues</p> <p>Topics:</p> <ul> <li>Required Updates:</li> <li>Poor Documentation:</li> <li>Subscriptions / Ownership:</li> </ul>"},{"location":"free_dj_tools/#knowledge-base-organization","title":"Knowledge base organization","text":"<p>I'm looking for a solution to organize this knowledge base :)</p> <p>Any help is welcome.</p> <p>Requirements:</p> <ul> <li>Have everything in a single markdown page</li> <li>TOC <ul> <li>Left sidebar always visible</li> <li>auto generated</li> <li>Expandable sections </li> </ul> </li> <li>All headers with link anchors  </li> <li>\"git push\" triggers pipeline </li> </ul> <p>Non-requirements:</p> <ul> <li>chronological blog posts</li> <li>separate files</li> <li>categories</li> <li>multiple users</li> <li>user comments</li> </ul> <p>Candidates:</p> <ul> <li>readthedocs site</li> <li>readthedocs template for jekyll </li> <li>mkdocs, runthedocs, justthedocs</li> <li>github wiki</li> <li>github pages (default template)</li> <li>minimal mistakes jekyll template</li> <li>mediawiki</li> </ul>"},{"location":"free_mappings/","title":"Free Mappings","text":"<p>This section covers my free mappings on the DJTT site.\\ Below the direct links, and after this the description of each mapping.</p> <ul> <li>Main Traktor mappings</li> <li>DDJ-1000 with jog screens: https://maps.djtechtools.com/mappings/9279</li> <li>DDJ-SZ / DDJ-SX2 / DDJ-SRT: https://maps.djtechtools.com/mappings/9222</li> <li> <p>AKAI AMX: https://maps.djtechtools.com/mappings/9323</p> </li> <li> <p>Other mappings</p> </li> <li>XDJ-XZ: https://maps.djtechtools.com/mappings/10305</li> <li>Numark PartyMix: https://maps.djtechtools.com/mappings/9764</li> <li> <p>CDJ2000NX2: https://maps.djtechtools.com/mappings/9763</p> </li> <li> <p>Keyboard mappings</p> </li> <li>Beatgrid helper: https://maps.djtechtools.com/mappings/9760</li> <li>Transitions-Aligned Beatjumps: https://maps.djtechtools.com/mappings/9762</li> </ul>"},{"location":"free_mappings/#how-to-download-my-traktor-mappings","title":"How to DOWNLOAD my Traktor mappings:","text":"<p>TO DOWNLOAD: you can ONLY download my mappings from the DJ tech tools site (http://maps.djtechtools.com).\\ To do this you MUST register and then verify your email there.</p> <p>Note: sometimes that site is under maintenance.

So why do I use it with a controller made for Rekordbox, instead of the S4Mk3??</p> <p>Before we discuss this, please note that some years ago DJs could use any Software with any Hardware combination.  This was a fully supported (and encouraged!) model by the vendors, which used this model to make real money from real customers. </p> <p>Having said this, the DDJ-1000 has major features that I personally value significantly over the S4Mk3:</p> <ul> <li> <p>A) BIG jogs wheels: This is so important that it gets a dedicated blog post </p> </li> <li> <p>B) More pad modes. All my most useful functions are a maximum of 2 clicks away - and without using any shifts.    Main Pad modes are a) Hotcue, b) Roll/padFX, c) MacroFX, d) JogFX.    Pressing twice the same pad mode cycles the top 2 sub-pages of that pad mode. This is way the Reloop Elite mixer works.    I\u2019ve got even more stuff on the secondary pad modes, accessible with a shift+mode. </p> </li> <li> <p>C) Two USB ports. This is crucial for seamless hand-overs between DJs; and for safety of connecting a backup laptop ready at any time.</p> </li> <li> <p>D) JogFX combos on the jogs. Please see them in my demo videos (eg 6:32 of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9tQZEHr8hk&amp;t=392s ).    This is turnkey in my mapping, i\u2019m not familiar if they have it on the S4mk3 (it was present for sure on the S4MK1 DJTT mappings)</p> </li> <li> <p>E) BeatFx. This is in the correct place of the mixer (lower right corner = right hand of the DJ), with a FX selector knob to select the effect by name</p> </li> <li> <p>F) Connectivity. Thr DDJ-1000 has more inputs and outputs, microphones etc. In particular, the mixer has a full FX suite for any external inputs (colorFX + beatFX)</p> </li> </ul> <p>Note: the S4mk3 is a fantastic controller - I have recommended it to several people before. In particular the loop/beatjump encoders implementation is the gold standard for that.\\ The overall integration is better, of course, which is a plus if you prefer plug-and-play vs customization. </p> <p>But in the end its really the big jogwheels that is the crucial deal breaker; This was completely abandoned by NI in 2014 with the release of the S8, and was only picked-up in 2018 with the S4MK3 (although, in my opinion, still not the same as the DDJ-1000).</p>"},{"location":"hardware_controllers/#ddj-1000-comparison-to-ddj-sz-and-akai-amx","title":"DDJ-1000 comparison to DDJ-SZ and AKAI AMX","text":"<p>Besides my DDJ-1000, I have several other controllers fully mapped to Traktor. </p> <p>Main differences are:</p> <p>DDJ-1000:</p> <ul> <li>Jogs: CDJ big Jogwheels </li> <li>Screens: Jog screens</li> <li>Size: More portable than SZ, but more cramped as well</li> <li>BeatFX: BeatFX in the lower right corner to the mixer</li> </ul> <p>DDJ-SZ:</p> <ul> <li>Size: Very spacious.

The one in the back is for right to left movement and the one in the front is for front to back movement. </p> <p>If you have a jog wheel that is loose this is the part that has failed or has come defective from manufacturing. </p> <p>These barrels sit inside of a channel on the under side of the jog wheel top plate ( where your hand makes contact to scratch )</p> <p>The way the barrels are held onto the bracket is they are pressed into the bracket and center-punched to mushroom the metal to lock it in place on the bottom. </p> <ul> <li> <p>When a jog wheel develops front to back movement the front barrel will be found to be loose and exhibit a wobble on the bracket. </p> </li> <li> <p>When a jog wheel develops side to side movement the rear barrel will be found to be loose and exhibit a wobble on the bracket. </p> </li> </ul> <p>If you are able to carefully center punch the shaft from the bottom of the bracket it is possible to re-secure the barrel. Once the barrel is secured properly to the bracket your movement in your jog wheel will be eliminated. </p> <p>I\u2019m trying to get a part number(s) in case anyone is tired of sending in their unit and it coming back not fixed. </p> <p>Honestly this is something that pioneer should have done a recall on as I\u2019ve seen so many posts about it here and on forums and have spoke to SAM ASH and Guitar Center with both retailers aware and complaining about the issue. </p> <p>Pioneers stance is to keep quiet when all they had to do is replace this bracket that probably cost them 5.00 to have made. </p> <p>The labor for the repair is most likely why they are keeping quiet. It\u2019s just unacceptable.</p> <p>This is the part that is causing all the problems. I think it\u2019s expensive for what it is but at least we have all the information we need. Please share this entire post if this can help someone.</p> <p>https://www.instrumentalparts.com/stay-assy-jog/</p> <p>Once you remove the back cover you will see many ribbon cables going to a main PCB. Once you remove all of those cables you will start to unscrew the Main PCB and lift out. After that you will need to take out the track load PCB the pad assy pcb and the loop pcb. once you remove those you can access the jog wheel screws. Note you will have to remove the track select knob , the tension adjust knob and the pitch slider cap to remove above boards before getting to the jog assy. unscrew 5 or 6 screw and remove jog assy and then you will see 2 tabs that can be pulled back gently and the jog wheel lifts up and off the unit. that's the easy part. keeping all the screws in order and where they go is something you should draw out somewhere or take pictures for the first time. ALSO make sure all the plastic buttons are seated properly when you put all the PCBs back so you don't have to reopen the device after you fully assemble it. Hope that helps</p> <p>Understand how to remove the different ribbons cables, also there's a few wires that need to be placed back a certain way, if you keep good notes and have opened and worked around electronics before you can probably do it, but as I stated before... Unless you know what your doing and have some experience in working on electronics or computers I would have someone else do it.</p> <p>it\u2019s not easy and I would only recommend you attempt if your good with working on electronics. You have to disassemble a lot of the controller just to get the jog wheel out.

The difference is on the how; In my case I manage the collection only in OS-folders, instead of DJ-playlists.</p> <p>Main reasons are:</p> <ul> <li>#1: Multiple Windows: File explorer opens instantaneously with Win+E, and allows any number of windows, monitors and tabs. </li> <li>#2: Tree Tagging: More crucially, all windows have the whole tree visible. This is essential to quickly tag my files by just moving them to the correct correct folder. Similarly, the structure grows just by creating new sub-folders as needed.</li> <li>#3: Simpler Folders: OS-Folders contain either files, sub-folders, or both. This 2-step organization is simpler is than the iTunes 3-step model of \"folders -&gt; playlists -&gt; files\" (later copied by almost all DJ softwares).</li> <li>#4: Local Searches: By far my most common task is to check if I already have a particular track, and where is it tagged. File explorer allows local searches on a folder and its sub-folders only. This enables me to quickly find things by just typing a few letters of the filename. AFAIK only Serato has this feature (called \"include subcrates\")</li> <li>#5: Tags Cleanup: Before tagging the file, I rename the filenames to correct its artist / title. MP3tag helps a lot to clean up the formatting, using my own scripts to automatically capitalize the names as \u201cARTIST1 ft. ARTIST2 - Capitalized Title - Remix\u201d, and to update the internal mp3 tags. </li> <li>#6: Software Independence: Using OS-folders you are independent of any possible DJ software and itunes. It also trivial to sync between laptops and make perfect backups to my NAS. It is also trivial to load a whole genres to USB sticks to listen in cars.</li> </ul> <p>See also this blog post for more details on my workflow between DJ softwares .</p> <p>See also this reddit post for a realy good organiztion using a databse</p>"},{"location":"os_folders/#how-to-manage-your-collection-using-operating-systems-folders-and-without-dj-playlists-ie-using-only-finder-windows-explorer-etc","title":"How to manage your collection using operating systems folders and without DJ playlists (ie, using only Finder, Windows Explorer, etc)","text":"<p>Above I've described Why I manage music using OS-folders only. In this post I will describe how I manged to fully automate my workflow between DJ softwares.</p> <ul> <li>#0: File operations: As explained above I continuously search files, change the filenames and move the files around left and right.</li> <li>#1: Traktor Repair: When I first open Traktor, it automatically repairs its own database. For this I just run a mass-relocate on my whole music root folder, which refinds all moved and renames files in a single go.</li> <li>#2: Update collection: The second step is just to import the whole music root folder into Traktor. As this skips previous files, in practice it only imports the New files. The last step is to delete the remaining missing files (that are really deleted - otherwise they would been found on step #1) </li> <li>#3: Duplicate Cues: For the rare cases that a file is in multiple sub-genres, I just copy them physically in different folders. I have 10% of duplicated files. Then I run a python script to automatically duplicate the CUEs for these files. This tool is similar to the traktor Librarian.</li> <li>#4: Dj Converter: I use the DJ Data Converter to generate the rekordbox.xml file without the 26ms shift problem.</li> <li>#5: Rekordbox Import: On rekordox first I delete all missing files, then import the whole collection \"as-is\", and then update the collection with the XML file that came from the (repaired) Traktor collection. These steps are fully automatic and it ensures the Rekordbox collection matches the Traktor collection.</li> <li>#6: Rekordbox Search: I only use rekordbox for video gigs. There I use the explorer node to see my files, and search for files in the whole collection. For the rare case I need to search inside a \"playlist\", I use a real File Explorer window in parallel when needed (because rekordbox still lacks a search box in OS-folders)</li> <li>#7: CDJ export: I only really need playlists for CDJs. There are scripts to mass-convert all folders to DJ playlists. Then I do the usual rekordbox step to prepare USBs pens.<ul> <li>Windows version is http://samsoft.org.uk/iTunes/ImportFolderStructure.vbs; </li> <li>Mac version is https://dougscripts.com/itunes/scripts/ss.php?sp=droptoaddnmake; </li> <li>A Serato-specific version is in https://code.google.com/archive/p/serato-itch-sync/</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>See also the DJCU workflow from ATGR.</p>"},{"location":"os_folders/#do-you-use-mp3-file-metadata","title":"Do you use mp3 file metadata?","text":"<p>I do not use metadata, not even the \"genre\" field.

Also tried to use a windows file explorer clone for mac, it was completely abandoned by the author. * b) No flexibility: AKA the \"one apple way\". I've never got used to their GUI, their keyboard shortcuts,  and the keyboard itself.  In particular there is the extremely annoying decision of having to use 2 hands for the  forward delete key.
